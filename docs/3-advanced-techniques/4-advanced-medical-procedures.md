# Advanced Medical Procedures

## 1. Introduction

Using the Ace3 Medical System is vital to sustaining optimal battlefield operational status, even a basic rifleman will need to know at least the basics of the medical system to help assist medical personnel in treating them or another operative.

## 2. Controls and UI

To use the medical system you will need to use your Ace Interaction key, By default 'Windows Key'.

Self Interacting with '**Ctrl + Windows key**' will allow you to treat yourself.  
Interacting on another person using '**Windows key**' will let you treat them.  

When interacting with yourself you will be presented with a list of all your body parts.  
For patients you will need to interact with that specific body part by looking at the body part in question and interacting.  
\
\
There are visual and/or audio cues that will let you know if you have medical issues.  

Your vision being affected by chromatic aberration or distortion indicates you are in pain.  
Losing saturation from your vision (Turning Black and white) indicates blood loss.  
Blood spots on the edge of your screen indicates open wounds.  
Loud ringing can indicate hearing damage or tinnitus.  This can be prevented in most scenarios by using ear plugs.

## 3. Common Injuries

You will encounter many different types of injuries.  
Such as Velocity, Avulsions, Contusions, Abrasions, Lacerations, Cuts, Punctures and Crush.  
Not only are there different types but also Intensities, Minor, Medium and Large.  

These mostly tell you the cause of an injury, In most cases velocity and avulsions are caused from gunshot wounds.  
You can also suffer from Fractures these are depicted by a Red bone and are treated using a Splint.  
There is a [chart](#_4a-bandages) further below that will tell you what bandages work best for certain wounds.  

## 4. Medical equipment

This section will cover all the medical equipment you will use in many cases.

### 4a. Bandages

Bandages are very important and one of your main tools to assist fellow operatives.  

There are 4 kinds of Bandages,  
**Field Dressings** - Run of the mill Bandage can be used on most wounds aside from Velocity and Abrasions.  
**Packing Bandages** - Same effectiveness as a Field dressing with higher reopening chance.  
**Elastic Bandages** - The Butter to your Bread and Butter, Very high effectiveness but also very high reopening chance.  
**QuikClot** - The Bread to your Bread and Butter, Mediocre effectiveness with very low chance of reopening.  

Below is a Chart that will reflect the specifics.  
![Effectiveness of Bandages](https://ace3mod.com/img/wiki/feature/medical1.jpg)

Using Quikclots first followed by Elastics will be your Bread and Butter for treating Wounds. It is recommended that riflemen should take 10 of each.

### 4b. Kits

There are three kits available to medics, The **PAK (Personal Aid Kit)**, The **Surgical Kit** and lastly the **Defibrillator**.  

The **PAK** or **Personal Aid Kit** when used on a person after a lengthy time will heal them fully, this item is a one time use.  
The best time to use this item is when you have no other choice, example being either you will run out of medical to heal them or if you are on the clock and getting them up is mandatory.  
Note: PAK's are very heavy and will take a long time to use based on how wounded the Patient and will vanish after use.  

The **Surgical Kit** on the other hand is reusable and is used to stitch wounds after bandaging.  
The Surgical kit should only be used if you have adequate protection or if not using it will result in the death of a squadmate or yourself.  
Depending on the amount of wounds needing to be stitched the time required will differ with more wounds taking a longer time to complete.  

The **Defribrillator** does what you would expect, It restores a heartrate to the patient.  
Note this does cause pain to Operators nearby to the Patient, good etiquette would be to warn prior to use,  
Example being, "Using Defib, clear the area".  

### 4c. Auto Injectors  

**Morphine**  
Your go to when you are in pain, Morphine does 2 things, It lowers heart rate and dulls pain.  
Morphine can be dangerous if you inject too many within a short time span, you will put the patient into cardiac arrest,  
It takes around 30 seconds to get to full effect and it takes 30 minutes for the morphine to leave the patients system.   
Recommended max dosage of 1 injections per 10 minutes.  

**Epinephrine**  
Increases the patients heart rate, unlike Morphine, Epinephrine does not dull pain.  
Compared to Morphine, Epinephrine leaves the patients system rather quickly only taking a few minutes to do so.  
It will reach its full effect around 10 seconds after being injected.   
Recommended max dosage of 5 injections per 2 minutes.  

**Adenosine**  
These injectors slow down the patients heart rate almost comparable to morphine.  
It isn't often you will find a use for these however, the main purpose of Adenosine is to lower heart rate,  
In turn one use case for Adenosine is when the heart rate of the patient is too high.  
It reaches full effect around 15 seconds after injecting and will leave the patients system in a few minutes.  
Recommended max dosage of 2 injections per 2 minutes.  

### 4d. IV - Blood Bags  

**Blood**
As the name would imply these are blood bags which come in 3 different sizes, 250, 500 and lastly 1000.  
These are best used in a safe position or under protection from fellow operators,  
It takes time to apply the Transfusion and is the only way to restore blood to the patient aside from a PAK.  

**Plasma and Saline**
As of yet, Plasma and Saline serve the same function as Blood and serve no additional benefits. "Piss bags" also serve the same purpose.

### 4e. Other  

**Tourniquet**  
Tourniquets if you are unfamiliar are tight bands used to completely stop the blood flow to a wound.  
In short these allow you to stop the bleeding for some time if you need to focus elsewhere or,  
If the amount of wounds on the body part is far too great to bandage quickly.  

Please note Tourniquets can only be used on limbs, Arms and Legs.  
They will cause pain if left applied for too long.  

**Splint**  
Splints heal fractured limbs but take a short while to apply.  
Best used in non critical situations.  

## 5. Treatment Procedure

### 5a. Self Treatment

Understanding when and where you should treat yourself is very important.  

First you need to assess is it safe to stop and treat yourself, if not relocate to a safe location.  
Next you should evaluate which wounds should be treated first, something like a small cut is not nearly as important as several large avulsions.  
If you have a large amount of wounds it is advised to tourniquet open wounds first before moving onto treating.  
Focusing on maintaining mobility in case of a sudden need to relocate from spontaeous contact or order of rapid retreat.  

A Priority list for wounds to treat first.

1. Broken Leg / Wound that limits your movement severely e.g making you limp.
2. Severe Pain / When in too much pain you have a chance to fall unconcious.
3. Open Wounds / If you have too many open wounds it will cause your blood pressure to drop rapidly.
4. Minimal Pain / Pain can make it very hard to aim and damage your vision.
5. Large Bloodloss / While Blood is very important it takes a long time to apply and should only be done when safe.
6. Everything Else.  


### 5b. Treatment

Mostly similar to when you're treating yourself, however you must keep your patient and yourself safe.
In almost every case you should prioritise your own safety over non medical personnel, If you go down no one will be brought back.  

Again same as when deciding to treat yourself providing medical aid to a patient should follow similar checks.  
First you should radio in "Operator Down" replacing Operator with the Patients name or simply "Man" is perfectly fine.  
Second, assess if you are safe and able to secure and treat the patient, If the patient is in a dangerous location try and clear  
the area first before moving the patient to a safe location to treat them.
The Main goal of treating the patient is to get them up and operational, if you can't do so stabilising the patient to the best of your abilities.

A Priority list for treating a Patient.

1. Diagnose Injuries / Checking the patient to decide what to Treat first is Mandatory.
2. Open Wounds / Open Wounds are the most dangerous thing that needs to treated first or the patient could bleed out rapidly.
3. Heartrate / Restoring the Patients heartrate is important as the patient will die from cardiac arrest.
4. Broken Limbs / Broken Limbs cause severe pain and will keep the patient unconcious.
5. Blood / Restoring the patients blood pressure is vital for them to wake up 120/80 is the norm.
6. Pain / While in pain the patient can't wake up it will not kill them and should be taken care of last.
7. Everything else.

## 6. Casualty Types

- **Tier 0 / KIA:** Patient is dead
- **Tier 1 / CRITICAL:** Patient is in need of immediate medical attention _and requires attention from multiple people_
- **Tier 2 / UNSTABLE :** Patient is in need of immediate medical attention _but only requires one person to stabilize_
- **Tier 3 / STABLE:** Patient is currently stabilized and only requires resuscitation (stitch and/or defib/cpr)
- **Tier 4 / RED / "WALKING-WOUNDED":** Patient is currently conscious but is bleeding and/or their ability to fight is inhibited (broken legs/arms)
- **Tier 5 / YELLOW:** Patient is conscious and stable but is in need of pain relief or blood trsnfusion only
- **Tier 6 / GREEN:** Patient is not in need of any sort of treatment (psychological damage irrelevant)

## 7. Tips

Use Tourniquets or our medic will be sad
Remove tourniquets when you’re done
Only use a PAK when it is really needed.
Don’t overdose on morphine. Remember: Overdose = Comatose

## 8. TL;DR

Elastics for temporary, QuickClot for lasting

You get booboo? Tourniquet and fix

Don’t keep a tourniquet on for too long

In pain? Morphine

Someone is down and has no heart rate? Bandage and PAK them

Stay woke, stay frosty.
